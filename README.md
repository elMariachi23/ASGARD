# ASGARD

In Norse religion, Asgard (/ˈɑːsɡɑːrd, ˈæs-/;[1] Old Norse: Ásgarðr; "Enclosure of the Æsir"[2]) is one of the Nine Worlds and home to the Æsir tribe of gods. It is surrounded by an incomplete wall attributed to a Hrimthurs riding the stallion Svaðilfari, according to Gylfaginning. Odin and his wife, Frigg, are the rulers of Asgard.
